#### Ada Lovelace

Ada Lovelace was a Mathematician born in 1815 to famed poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabelle Milbanke. She was swayed by her mother to pursue a future in mathematics unlike her father who was a poet. As she continued to endeavor in math, she met Charles Babbage, who paired up with Ada to create the Analytical Engine, which was a calculator of sorts. As time passed it became obvious that Ada understood more about the Analytical Engine than it's inventor, Babbage himself. Ada wrote: "[The Analytical Engine] can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. it can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. She was the first to realize and propose that 'computers' could do anything, as long as we knew how to tell it to.
